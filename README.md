# Malware Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms
This project was built with a vision to classify legitimate samples and malware containing samples in the dataset.

### Acknowledgement:

The dataset is taken from Prateek Lalwani's GitHub repository, who is a security blogger and can be found at: https://github.com/prk54/malware-detection-machine-learning-approach/blob/master/data.csv

### The Algorithms used in the project are:
**1. Extra Trees Classifier**: For Feature Selection

**2. Random Forest Classifier**: For Classification

**3. Gradient Boost Classfier**: For Classification

**4. Ada Boost Classifier**: For Classification

### Conclusion:
After performing classification task on the given datset using different algorithms, I concluded the accuracy of different classifiers is in the order :

**Random Forest Classifier > Gradient Boosting Classifier >  AdaBoost Classifier**
